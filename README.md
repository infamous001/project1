# project1
This is my first project using tensor flow and I have used sequential api for classification and regression

Here i have classified fashion_mnist dataset using tensforflow 
    i have used 4 layers 
    1 for flattening
    2 hidden layers with relu activation function
    1 ouput layer with softmax activation function since it is a multiclass classification
Here i havent applied hyperparameter tuning here so the accuracy i got is pretty low
